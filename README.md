# BoiLES
Bayesian optimization for implicit large eddy simulation

A light weight toolkit that helps build ILES scheme using Bayesian optimization (BO) which are based on [gpytorch](https://gpytorch.ai/), [botorch](https://botorch.org/) and [ax](https://ax.dev/). Anyone who is interested in BO is referred to Martin Krasser's blog "[Bayesian optimization](http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/21/bayesian-optimization/)"

The CFD solver, ALPACA, is named by "Adaptive Level-set Parallel Code". It is a multiresolution compressible multiphase flow solver developed at Prof. Adams' [Chair of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics (AER)](https://www.mw.tum.de/en/aer/home/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/).
